# Active Directory Architecture

Active Directory follows a **client-server architecture**.

The server side is handled by **Domain Controllers**.
The client side includes:
- User computers
- Servers
- Applications

Active Directory internally works as a database.
This database stores:
- Users
- Groups
- Computers
- Policies
- Permissions

The AD database is replicated across multiple servers
to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

Important idea:
Active Directory is NOT a single server.
It is a distributed system working together as one logical unit.
