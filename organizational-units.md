# Organizational Units (OU)

Organizational Units are containers used
to organize objects inside a domain.

OUs allow administrators to:
- Apply Group Policies
- Delegate administration
- Organize structure logically

Example:
Company
 ├── HR OU
 ├── IT OU
 └── Finance OU

Important concept:
Group Policies are linked to OUs,
not directly to users or groups.
