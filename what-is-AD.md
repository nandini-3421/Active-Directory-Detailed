# What is Active Directory?

Active Directory (AD) is a **centralized directory service** developed by Microsoft.
It is used to manage users, computers, and resources in a Windows-based network.

In simple words, Active Directory is like a **digital phonebook + security system**
for an organization.

Instead of managing users separately on every computer,
Active Directory allows everything to be managed from one central place.

Active Directory answers questions like:
- Who are you?
- What are you allowed to access?
- Which computer are you using?
- What policies apply to you?

Without Active Directory, large organizations would be almost impossible to manage.
