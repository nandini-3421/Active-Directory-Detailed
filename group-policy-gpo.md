# Group Policy (GPO)

Group Policy allows administrators
to control how users and computers behave.

Using GPO, admins can:
- Enforce password rules
- Disable USB devices
- Control desktop settings
- Install software automatically

Group Policy is applied in this order:
Local → Site → Domain → OU

This order is important during troubleshooting.

Group Policy is one of the strongest
security and management tools in Active Directory.
