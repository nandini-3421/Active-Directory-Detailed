# Role of DNS in Active Directory

Active Directory is tightly integrated with DNS.

DNS helps:
- Locate Domain Controllers
- Resolve service records
- Enable authentication

If DNS is misconfigured:
- Users cannot log in
- Group Policies fail
- AD becomes unstable

This is why DNS problems are
the most common cause of AD issues.
