# Users, Groups, and Computers

Users represent people or services.
Computers represent machines joined to the domain.

Groups are used to simplify permission management.

Instead of:
Giving permissions to 50 users individually

We:
Create a group
Add users to the group
Assign permissions to the group

This approach is:
- Easier to manage
- More secure
- Industry best practice
