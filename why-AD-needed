# Why Active Directory is Needed

Imagine a company with 500 employees.

Without Active Directory:
- Each computer has its own users
- Passwords must be created manually everywhere
- No central control
- Huge security risk
- Very difficult to manage permissions

With Active Directory:
- One user account works everywhere
- Central login system
- Central security policies
- Easy access control
- Auditing and monitoring become possible

Real-world example:
An employee joins HR department.
Admin creates ONE user in Active Directory.
That user automatically gets:
- Email access
- File server access
- HR application access

This is the power of Active Directory.
