# Active Directory Security

Active Directory security is critical
because compromising AD means compromising the organization.

Key security principles:
- Least privilege
- Strong passwords
- Separate admin accounts
- Regular auditing

Highly privileged groups:
- Domain Admins
- Enterprise Admins

If these accounts are compromised,
attackers gain full control of the domain.
