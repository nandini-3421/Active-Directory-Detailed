# Common Active Directory Attacks

Attackers target Active Directory
because it controls everything.

Common attacks include:
- Password spraying
- Kerberoasting
- Pass-the-Hash
- Golden Ticket attacks

Most AD attacks succeed not because of exploits,
but because of:
- Weak passwords
- Poor configuration
- Excessive privileges
