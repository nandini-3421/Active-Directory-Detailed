# Active Directory Objects

Everything stored in Active Directory is called an **object**.

Examples of objects:
- User
- Computer
- Group
- Printer

Each object has **attributes**.
Attributes describe the object.

Example:
A user object has:
- Username
- Password (hashed)
- Email
- Group memberships

Active Directory is essentially a
structured database of objects and attributes.
